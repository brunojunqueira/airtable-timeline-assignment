# Airtable timeline assignment

I like the way I implemented the components. Everything is in its place, and we can easily find and modify things whenever needed.

If I were to do it again, I would improve the timeline's style and add some features I couldn’t implement due to time constraints, such as drag-and-drop for date changes and a details card for each item, displayed in a single modal with all the information.

I made these design decisions because it’s the most convenient and widely used way to display items on a timeline. I looked at Dribbble for some inspiration, but I didn’t use any specific reference.

If I had more time, I would test whether each event correctly fits its respective date on the timeline, and whether changes properly match the corresponding item ID.
